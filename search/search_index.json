For example:</p> <pre><code>nav:\n- Home: index.md\n- My New Page: my-new-page.md\n</code></pre> How do I add images or assets? <p>You can place images (like .png, .jpg) or other files (like PDFs) directly inside your docs/ folder, or in subfolders within docs/ (e.g., docs/images/).</p> <p>Solution: Use relative paths in your Markdown:</p> Image Location Markdown Syntax Same folder as .md <code>![Alt Text](image.png)</code> Inside docs/images/ and .md is in docs/ <code>![Alt Text](images/image.png)</code> .md is in docs/section/ and image in docs/images/ <code>![Alt Text](../images/image.png)</code> Can I use HTML inside Markdown files? <p>Yes, you can! Markdown is designed to work well with HTML. If Markdown doesn't offer a specific formatting option, you can often just write standard HTML directly within your .md files.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>&lt;div style=\"color: blue; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid blue;\"&gt;\nThis content is inside an HTML div!\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre> How do I update my deployed site? <p>When you make changes to your documentation (add pages, edit content, change mkdocs.yml), you need to \"re-deploy\" them for the changes to appear online.</p> <p>Solution: 1. Save all your changes locally. 2. Commit your changes to Git: <pre><code>git add .\ngit commit -m \"Your update message\"\n</code></pre> 3. Run the deploy command: <pre><code>mkdocs gh-deploy\n</code></pre></p> <p>This will build your updated site and push it to GitHub Pages.</p> How do I add collapsible sections or tabs? <p>The Material for MkDocs theme supports many advanced features, including collapsible sections and tabs. </p> <p>These require enabling specific Markdown extensions in your mkdocs.yml.</p> <p>Solution: Enable extensions in mkdocs.yml:</p> <pre><code>markdown_extensions:\n- pymdownx.details\n- pymdownx.superfences\n- pymdownx.tabbed\n</code></pre> <p>Use this syntax in your .md files:</p> <p>Collapsible Section:</p> <pre><code>??? \"Click to expand\"\n    This content is hidden until clicked.\n</code></pre> <p>Tabbed Content:</p> <pre><code>=== \"Tab 1\"\n    Content for tab 1.\n\n=== \"Tab 2\"\n    Content for tab 2.\n</code></pre> Is MkDocs good for API documentation? <p>Yes, MkDocs, especially when combined with the Material for MkDocs theme, is a great choice for API documentation.</p> <p>Solution: Look into plugins like <code>mkdocs-openapi</code> or <code>mkdocs-swagger-ui-plugin</code> to display your API definitions beautifully.</p> Where can I learn more? <p>The best places to get more in-depth information are the official documentation sites for MkDocs and the Material for MkDocs theme.</p> <p>Solution: </p> <ul> <li>MkDocs Official Docs</li> <li>Material for MkDocs Docs</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Installation/","title":"Install MkDocs","text":"<p>This page will show you how to get MkDocs set up and ready to use on your computer. </p>"},{"location":"Installation/#requirements","title":"Requirements","text":"<p>To use MkDocs, you need two things:</p> <ul> <li>Python 3.x: A programming language that MkDocs uses.</li> <li>pip: A tool that helps install Python programs.
